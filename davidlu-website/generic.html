								<h2>Hobbies, interests and more</h2>
								<p>Hi, my name is David, and I'm currently 20 years old. As you already know I'm a Waterloo student, studying computer science. Some interests of mine include playing sports like hockey (I'm the 3rd one from the left in the picture) and volleyball, working out, cooking, and gaming. I also really enjoy listening to and playing music. I used to play a couple of instuments like piano and the saxophone back in high school. </p>
								<p>Due to current circumstances and how we have to stay at home, it's been harder to see friends and be as active as I'd like to. Recently I've picked up some activities like streaming my games, drawing and cooking more with my family. </p>
								<h2>Future goals</h2>
								<p>At the moment I'm not really sure what I'll be doing in the future, and it's been worrying me moreso recently, since I'm getting older. As of right now, I'd really like to work at Google or work as a game developer at Riot Games. </p>
